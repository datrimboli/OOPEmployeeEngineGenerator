# OOPEmployeeEngineGenerator

### This project allows the user to create their "team"

The team can consist of three different types of employees. 

Those types are:
####-Engineer
####-Manager
####-Intern

All employees will have a name, id number, and email.  An enginner will also have a github name, a manager will have an office number, and an intern will have a school property.

In the terminal, the user will first be asked to select which type of employee they would like to create.  Upon entering the desired employee information, and finishing the creation of the employee, the user will then again be asked if they would like to create another employee, or finish. 

Continue creating employees until you have the team that you desire!
